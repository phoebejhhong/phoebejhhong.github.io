Yes, authors who lack certain experience can always benefit from the eyes of the more knowledgeable.</p>\n<p>But hey, code review is definitely a two-way street! Reviewers learn a ton too! So, here I have compiled the list of things we learn when we review code.</p>\n<h3>We learn more about the codebase</h3>\n<p>In short term, we learn about that bit of code. And we say, 'I can fix bugs in this bit of code next time the author is on leave'.\nAlso in long term, we obtain broader view of the codebase. What are the prevalent patterns that are being used? What are the 3rd party libraries we are using? Where are the parts of code that can potentially combined together? These are some of the example questions that can be answered only by those who read code that they didn't write (unless codebase is written by one person!).</p>\n<h3>We learn more about the product</h3>\n<h3>We learn how to code better</h3>\n<h3>We learn more about my coworkers</h3>\n<h3>We learn how to communicate better</h3>\n<h3>We learn how to read code better</h3>\n<p>Our coworkers in different functions might exchange emails and spreadsheets, but we primarily write code and read each other's code.  and it may be the most important communication tool we make use of everyday.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What we learn when we review code","date":"2019-07-22","slug":"code-review","keywords":"bias"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/code-review/"}}}
