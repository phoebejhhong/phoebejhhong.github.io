Yes, authors who lack certain experience can always benefit from the eyes of the more knowledgeable.</p>\n<p>But hey, code review is definitely a two-way street! Reviewers learn a ton too! So, here I have compiled the list of things we learn when we review code.</p>\n<h3>We learn more about the codebase</h3>\n<p>In short term, we learn about that bit of code. And we say, 'I can fix bugs in this bit of code next time the author is on leave'.\nAlso in long term, we obtain broader view of the codebase. What are the prevalent patterns that are being used? What are the 3rd party libraries we are using? Where are the parts of code that can potentially combined together? These are some of the example questions that can be answered only by those who read code that they didn't write (unless codebase is written by one person!).</p>\n<h3>We learn more about the product</h3>\n<h3>We learn how to code better</h3>\n<h3>We learn more about my coworkers</h3>\n<h3>We learn how to communicate better</h3>\n<h3>We learn how to read code better</h3>\n<p>Our coworkers in different functions might exchange emails and spreadsheets, but we primarily write code and read each other's code.  and it may be the most important communication tool we make use of everyday.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"On bias","date":"2019-07-08","slug":"on-bias","keywords":"bias"},"html":""}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A simple case for Do Repeat Yourself","date":"2019-07-04","slug":"do-repeat-yourself","keywords":"development"},"html":"<p> The other day, I wrote a piece of code that went like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>panelType <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"A\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">PanelA</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">someProp</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>someProp<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>panelType <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"B\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">PanelB</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">someProp</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>someProp<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>panelType <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"C\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">PanelC</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">someProp</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>someProp<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<br />\n<p>And it was just ✨liberating✨</p>\n<p>\"Don't repeat yourself\" was one of the first software development principles I've ever learned. (Who didn't?) And it took me considerable time and lots of frustration at prematurely abstracted code until I unlearned the dogma. The day I rage-googled and stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction</a>, I was born again as an appreciator of the beauty of simplicity and straightforwardness.</p>\n<p>Say, for some reason, I \"refactored\" the code to look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> panelTypeComponentMap <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"A\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> PanelA<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"B\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> PanelB<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"C\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> PanelC<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> PanelComponent <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> panelTypeComponentMap<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>panelType<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">PanelComponent</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">someProp</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>someProp<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<br />\n<p>❌ Things the \"refactor\" didn't do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It didn't make code less bug-prone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the new code looks more organized, it might give you (false) sense of security. Still, any mistake you can make in the previous code, can be made in the latter code in the same manner.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It didn't make code easier to change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It doesn't particularly reduce the amount of effort needed to do something as simple as adding <code class=\"language-text\">PanelD</code> or removing <code class=\"language-text\">PanelB</code>. In a case a future design change requires passing different props to different panels, however, you can imagine how much more configuration we have to add in the latter code, whereas in the former, to put it in a very technically accurate term, it'd be super easy.</p>\n<p>✅ Things the \"refactor\" did do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It made code longer</li>\n<li>It made code more complex</li>\n</ul>\n<p> More lines of code means more work. I had to use my brain extra hard to come up with pretty much meaningless variable names like <code class=\"language-text\">panelTypeComponentMap</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">PanelComponent</code>. Imagine the toll on the future readers of the code, learning more <em>stuff</em>, jumping around the code because most likely <code class=\"language-text\">panelTypeComponentMap</code> is defined on the top of the file or, even worse, in a different file.</p>\n<p> More lines of code is bad, and to justify it, there has to be real good explicit benefit to cancel out its badness.</p>\n<p>This is a very simple example, but the whole point is to spare writer and reader's effort with something small like this so that they can focus on more important matter. Principle here is simple. Don't fix a problem that does not exist (yet). Write naive code, your many if statements will do just fine. You can fix it later when it becomes a real problem.</p>"}}]}}}
